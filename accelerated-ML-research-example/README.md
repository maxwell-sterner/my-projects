# Description:
Here is an example of the type of machine learning model I would setup for my accelerated machine learning research. The program loads a model from Keras, loads ImageNet data from
Tensorflow, using a rounding function to round all the values, and then feeds the data through the model. The printouts demonstrate how the accuracy of the increases or decreases 
with different configurations.

# To run:
Open file in google colab. 'Run all' once until data is loaded, then program will stop. 'Run all' again and program will run as expected.
