# Description:
I designed a music playlist creator web app by programming the backend in Node.js to host a local server and connect to a MongoDB database. I constructed multiple 
GET and POST requests to handle song information being fetched or updated in the database. I tied the project together by programming the frontend REACT that 
including a user-friendly interface, styling, and fetch calls to the Spotify Music API.

# To Run:
My react app folder is labelled “playlist-creator” and my server is called
“server.js”. The other files in the folder must be included to access the Spotify server
(client_credentials, etc). Both the Finals Deliverables folder and the playlist-creator folder need
a node_modules. To run, cd to “Final Deliverables” folder and node server.js/npm start
playlist-creator. My application uses a Spotify login so you need an account on Spotify. My
project works like Spotify or Apple Music’s application where you search up a song, then have
the ability to add it to a playlist or create a new playlist. The playlists are then viewable from the
home page where you find all your songs and filter then by name or artist.
